# The Munro Centre

A premium, conversion-focused website for **The Munro Centre** — a community-based, **not-for-profit** early learning and long day care centre at **UQ, St Lucia, Brisbane**, caring for local families since **1981**.

Two jobs, done well: **make parents want to book a tour**, and **rank locally on Google** for early-learning searches in St Lucia and inner-west Brisbane.

- **Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router) · React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS v4 · Motion · Radix UI (shadcn-style components)
- **Design:** warm, friendly, playful — Baloo 2 rounded display + Inter body, the bright logo palette (blue/yellow/green/red) as cheerful accents on a calm cream base, soft motion.
- **Standalone project:** this lives in its own folder and git repo — it is unrelated to any other project on the machine.

## Getting started

pnpm install
pnpm dev      # http://localhost:3200 (see .claude/launch.json)

## What's included (per Ana's brief)

- **Six real rooms** with age ranges (GTF, Bandicoots, Echidna, Cassowary Chicks, Cassowary, Kookaburra).
- **Kindy Approved** kindergarten program (Kookaburra room) — surfaced in the trust bar, Features and FAQ.
- **OWNA** named as the digital platform for communication & bookings (Features + FAQ + `lib/site.ts`).
- **Not-for-profit, community-based** positioning throughout (hero, Features, Impact, since-1981).
- **Multicultural & inclusive** — a signature "Every Family Is Welcome" section (18+ language greetings) plus real multicultural-storytelling, First Nations and reconciliation photography.
- **Meals provided via KGF** — a dedicated Meals section + trust bar + FAQ.
- A clear **Book a Tour** path everywhere (nav, hero, every room card, final CTA, sticky mobile bar) + a working form.

## Editing content

- **Copy:** `lib/content.ts`. **Business details (NAP, hours, OWNA, KGF):** `lib/site.ts` — must match your Google Business Profile exactly.
- **Photography:** `lib/images.ts` maps slots to files in `/public/images`.

## SEO — built in (on-page / technical)

Per-page metadata (title, description, local keywords, canonical, OpenGraph/Twitter, robots, geo tags), `lang="en-AU"`, structured data (`ChildCare`/`EducationalOrganization` with NAP + geo + hours + areaServed, per-room `EducationalOccupationalProgram`, `WebSite`, `FAQPage`), `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, manifest, generated OG/Twitter cards, fully static prerender, `next/image` + `next/font`, semantic headings with the locality keyword in the H1 and section H2s.

> No star rating is shown or emitted in schema — self-asserted ratings without genuine, verifiable reviews violate Google's policy. Add a real, sourced rating (from your Google Business Profile, with Review markup) once reviews exist.

## ⚠️ Before launch — supply / confirm

- [ ] **Philosophy:** replace the interim statement in `lib/content.ts` (`philosophy`) with Ana's final version.
- [ ] **Weekly menu photo:** add the image to `/public/images` and set `meals.menuImage` in `lib/content.ts` (currently a styled placeholder).
- [ ] **Opening hours:** confirm the real hours in `lib/site.ts` (`hours`) — currently a typical 7:30am–6:00pm placeholder.
- [ ] **Testimonials:** replace the placeholder sentiment in `lib/content.ts` (`testimonials`) with real, attributed Google/Facebook reviews.
- [ ] **Social URLs** and **legal/approved-provider name** in `lib/site.ts` (marked `CONFIRM`).
- [ ] **OWNA booking link:** if you have a direct OWNA enrolment URL, point the CTAs at it (or wire the form below to it).
- [ ] **Wire the tour form:** `app/actions.ts` validates and succeeds but doesn't deliver the lead yet — connect the `TODO(integration)` to email (Resend), Formspree, OWNA or a CRM.

## Off-page — to actually rank #1 locally

On-page is necessary but not sufficient:

- [ ] Verify a **Google Business Profile** at the exact NAP; add photos, hours, categories.
- [ ] Verify in **Google Search Console** (add the token to `metadata.verification.google` in `app/layout.tsx`) and submit the sitemap.
- [ ] Earn real **Google reviews**; build **local citations** (consistent NAP) and a few quality local backlinks.
- [ ] Run Google's **Rich Results Test** after deploy.

## Deploy

Optimised for **Vercel** (import repo → set production domain → deploy). Any Node host running `next build` / `next start` works.
